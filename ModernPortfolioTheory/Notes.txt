MPT:
- diversification is important
- combining assets in order to reduce unsystematic risk (i.e. component of stock's return that is not correlated with market moves)

Assumptions of MPT:
- Returns are normally distributed N(u,sigma). Note: returns might not be normally distributed
- Investors are risk averse (i.e. they are willing to take on more risk if get more reward)
- Investors are not allowed to short positions.


MPT construct optimal portfolio offering the maximum possible expected return for a given level of risk
- The efficient portfolio is the portfolio that has the highest reward for a given level of risk or lowest risk for a given return
