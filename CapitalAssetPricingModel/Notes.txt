Risks in Finance:
- Unsystematic Risk: Inherent to individual assets and can be reduced via diversification as noted by MPT
- Systematic Risk: Cannot be diversified away. Risk related to interest rates changes, recessions, wars, etc.

CAPM:
- Measures the Systematic Risk with a Beta parameter
- E[Ra] = Rf + (B*E[Rm-Rf])
    where B = Cov(Ra * Rm) / Var(Rm) or B = correlation(Ra,Rm) * (Sigma(Ra)/Sigma(Rm))


Correlation(Ra) = Cov(Ra,Rm) / (Sigma(Ra) * Sigma(Rm))

Beta can be computed via Linear Regression as well

E[Ra] = Rf + (B*E[Rm-Rf])
E[Ra] - Rf = alpha + (B*E[Rm-Rf]) where alpha is return net the benchmark
