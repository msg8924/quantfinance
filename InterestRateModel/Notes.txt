dxt = theta(u-xt)dt + sigma * dWt
- process is stationary while brownian motion is not
- forms basis of the model for interest rates (such as Vasicek mode) or currency exchange rates
- used in pairs trading strategy

dxt = change in time series
theta = rate of by which the process reverts towards to the mean
u = is the equilibrium or the mean value


Vasicek Model:
- simple short rate r(t) model
- bond, mortgages and credit derivatives are quite sensitive to r(t) interest rate changes
- IR modeling is quite complex
- r(t) models are affected by several factors to name a few: political decisions, government intervention and economic states
- assumes that the r(t) interest rates follows a mean reverting OU process

dr(t) = k(theta(u-r(t))dt)+ sigma * dWt
- where k is the speed of mean reversion. If this is high, it reverts back to mean fast else slowly
- r(t) is interest rate
- allows r(t) to be negative
