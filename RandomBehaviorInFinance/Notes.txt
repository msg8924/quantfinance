Types of Analysis:
- Fundamental
    - In depth analysis is a study of a given company
    - Several factors to consider - management teams, products and services, balance sheets and income statements
    - attempts to predict if the stock is undervalued or not based on intrinsic value of the company.
- Technical
    - is about historical data
    - interpret historical data and look for specific patterns in S(t) stock price to make predictions accordingly
- Quantitative
    - has an assumption all financial quantities have random behavior
    - we have to use randomness in our models so stochastic calculus and stochastic differential equations are needed

Measure Theory:
Sigma Algebra: is a family of subsets of a set X that follow a set of rules (short definition)
- X = {a,b}
- P(X) = { ∅, X, {a}, {b})
- Σ ⊆ P(X) is a sigma algebra if it follows these rules:
    1) ∅,  X ∈ Σ
    2) A ∈ Σ so should be A∁ ∈ Σ
    3) A1, A2, A3,...,An are in Σ then A = A1 ∪ A2 ∪ A3 U....∪ An
  Note: All sets in a sigma algebra are called measurable sets
- Ai sigma algebra on X, i ∈ I (some index set). Then ∩Ai is also a sigma algebra on X

Borel Sigma Algebra:
- For M ⊆ P(X), there is a smallest sigma algebra that contains M

Example X = { a, b ,c ,d }, then M = {{a},{b}}
   sigma(M) = { ∅, X, {a}, {b}, {a,b}, {b,c,d}, {a,c,d}, {c,d} }

Let X be a topological space. (We need open sets)
An open set has the following definition:
- A set U ⊆ R (reals) is open, if for every x ∈ U, there exists a number D such that (x-D, x+D) ⊆ U
- e.g. R numbers,  ∅, (a,b)

For example (a,b):
    Take D = min(x-a, b-x), then (x-D, x+D) ⊆ (a,b)

B(X) Borel sigma algebra (i.e. sigma algebra created by all open sets)






Random Behavior:
- R(t) = mean + x * standard deviation

We can define daily returns as RV drawn from normal distribution

Stock Price S(t) can be described by a W(t) random walk called a weiner process
W(t) has a continuous sample path, it is independent and normally distributed increments

Random Walks and Weiner Processes:
- Returns of a given stock price is N(mu, sigma^2) are normally distributed. NOTE: This is related to the Returns = (S(T+1) - S(T)) / S(T) and not the S(T) itself
